    "These notes are a sketch of what you should recall from your undergraduate linear algebra class. They are not meant for learning from, but more as a checklist of stuff you already know so that you can revise the parts you have forgotten.\n",

    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, algebra is the mathematical study of **structure**, just like geometry is the study of **space** and analysis is the study of **change**. Linear algebra, in particular, is the study of **linear maps** between **vector spaces**. For many students, linear algebra is the first experience of mathematical abstraction, and hence often felt to be unfamiliar and difficult.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction begins with the appreciation that mathematics is largely concerned with operations on elements in a set within some mathematical space. We start with something concrete and familiar - the basic vector space $\\mathbb{R}^n$ - then take gentle steps into more abstract territory before finally returning to concrete applications of linear algebra."

    "Motivation: Why is all this abstraction necessary?\n",
    "----\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction pays off because it allows us to generalize the same rules to many different mathematical contexts. For example, we will see that sets of points in Euclidean space, sets of matrices, sets of polynomial functions, sets of solutions of a homogeneous linear system in $n$ variables, are all examples of vector spaces. So with the right abstraction, we can be sure that our intuition in concrete systems like $\\mathbb{R}^3$ will carry over to, say, infinite-dimensional function spaces since both are vector spaces with linear maps."
